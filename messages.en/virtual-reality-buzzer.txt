Subject: Virtual reality buzzer
From: David 戴维 P. Solomon <daiwei@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

Hi all,

Apologies for the personal side here, but I’ve met this wonderful girl named Xiaomei (小美) and, well, to make a long story short, she’s set to move in with me next month! There’s just one small issue, and it’s something I thought maybe we could create a product to help with. See, when I’m doing my VR sessions, it’s easy for someone to sneak up on me because I can’t see or hear them. Awkward, to say the least! This inspired me to think up a product: A simple vibrating buzzer that attaches to a VR headset so it can be felt even during the most intense sequences. Connecting that to a radio controller, I could place the button outside of my study and Xiaomei could buzz me when she needs me, with no chance of me being caught by surprise. What do you think? I’m sure plenty of other VR enthusiasts might find themselves in a similar predicament, and this is a solution inexpensive enough to be an impulse buy.

Note about the radio chip you will be using.

Normally, reading XBus causes the microcontroller to block until data becomes available. 

However, this radio has a non-blocking XBus buffer. The non-blocking buffer will immediately return a value of -999 when no data is currently available.

Should make it easier.

Jie.
