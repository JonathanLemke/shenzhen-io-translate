A Decentralized Autonomous Corporation is a company run without human involvement. It has money and investors, but it makes decisions for itself on what to do with that money using information from multiple lower-level monitoring and analysis programs.

Some of my classmates were studying them when I was at Princeton, but lately the hype died down somewhat. I guess there are some still operating now, maybe even doing well. Why don’t we do the job for it and see what happens?
