Subject: Carbine target illuminator

We have a deal to create a highly portable infrared targeting device that automatically switches emitter modes based on range. At long range the aiming laser is on; at mid range the aiming laser switches to half power and turns on a 20-degree flood emitter, and at close range it switches completely to a 60-degree flood. I’ve placed a copy of the table on your desk.

As a mounted add-on for any type of carbine weapon, it has the potential to do very well across government and law enforcement agencies.

Carl, I understand your concerns, but let’s take this offline.
