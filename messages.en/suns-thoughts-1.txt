Subject: Recommendation: Beyond the Clockwork
From: 孙昊天 <sun@avalon.avalon>

Noted futurist Amber Posner’s latest book BEYOND THE CLOCKWORK is an important deep dive into the future of the human race. Specifically: What will humanity look like once we have essentially solved for our bodies? For almost all of recorded history we have been overwhelmingly motivated by the most basic of impulses. But that era is coming to a close now, and Avalon City is at the forefront of that transformation.

I won’t spoil Amber’s conclusions for you, but I will say this book has contributed materially to my thinking about where we go from here.
