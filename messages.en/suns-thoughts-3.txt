EXISTENCE WITHIN by Orbus Hua

In some sense, all existence is “existence within”: within a time, a place, a physical body. What are the limits of our minds? What might it be like to exist without a body, outside of oneself? This book attempts to answer these questions. Unfortunately, without direct experience, these topics can only be explored through conjecture and imagination. The real answers will have come in time— there are new forms of consciousness out there, waiting to be realized.
