Subject: Sushi robot!

Hey, so, want to help me out with a fun little project I’ve been planning for a while? It’s a sushi-making robot I like to call the Omakase 9000. Having tasty sushi clearly wasn’t a priority early on, but now that the Ocean’s Bounty project is finished I figured Avalon City could use a little more high-end dining options. I think I’ve got the mechanical aspects worked out, so all it needs now is your expert logic to make it run!

P.S. Don’t tell Lisa about it.

Whew, that went over even better than I expected. Not only was Lisa surprised, she really liked the food too! I’ll never forget how her face lit up when she had the first bite. I’m just glad I made her happy.

Thanks, I owe ya one!
