Subject: A message from SleepCUBES
From: SleepCUBES Customer Service <customerservice@sleep.cubes>

Dear SleepCUBES Customer,

Over the past week you may have seen the news about thefts and other security issues at SleepCUBES locations. We are reaching out to let all of our customers know that we are addressing the issue with the utmost urgency.

We have learned that recently-installed locking mechanisms at many SleepCUBE locations do not meet our security standards. These locks were manufactured by an independent subcontractor and in no way reflect the high quality that SleepCUBES strives to achieve in everything we do. Replacement of these locks is underway, and we will send another message when this process is complete.

At SleepCUBES, we are committed to providing customers with a safe place to rest in the midst of a busy world. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us and our Customer Service team will be happy to assist you.

SleepCUBES
Sleep sound, sleep safe.â„¢
