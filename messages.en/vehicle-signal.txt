Subject: Traffic signal

Once again we are set to contribute to a piece of a larger system for a company controlled by Sun Haotian. This one is a traffic signal for a six-way intersection, with support for emergency transponders that override the normal traffic pattern.

I don’t know any more than this.

No yellow signal. Does that mean they’re expecting robo-cars only? I wonder where they’d use this?

We shouldn’t speculate. It’s our job to provide well-engineered solutions, not play detective with a client’s overall plans.
