Subject: Three Kingdoms tokens
From: David 戴维 P. Solomon <daiwei@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

To my fellow expats: Have you gone to a 三国游乐园 (Three Kingdoms Land) yet? I just went to the one in Shenzhen. The recreations of ancient Chinese society there are *extremely* fascinating! You even get old metal coins that you have to use to buy things with—as if you were really in the past. I watched the reenactors take my coins and then count them by hand. Isn’t that bizarre? I thought they could use coin machines to count the money faster, so I negotiated a deal with them to build some here.

Um, wouldn’t a coin machine be a little out of place at a theme park that’s supposed to be a historical re-creation?

Carl, I’ve already spoken to them about the look. The machine will have beautiful carved faceplate design with dragons and heavenly mountains and all that stuff. It won’t look out of place at all.

The machine just has to know when you’ve put in the right coin total, such as the price of one 馒头. It rings a bell to let the person behind the counter know to hand you your item, then it makes change in real physical coins. It’s really like bygone times.

太好了! It is a small start, but like us, 三国游乐园 has global expansion in mind. As it is said, “千里之行, 始于足下…”
