Subject: Spoiler-blocking headphones
From: David 戴维 P. Solomon <daiwei@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

Like many people in the office, I am a huge fan of the 大众娱乐 miniseries *Get The Throne*. The heroics, villainy, and sudden plot reversals have my wife Xiaomei and I waiting with bated breath for each new episode!

Unfortunately we missed last night’s and this morning I overheard people in the office discussing the latest twist before I could say anything! Surely there is some way to prevent being spoiled like this, perhaps with headphones that replace discussions of certain television shows with scrambled audio?

Heh. Sorry about that mate!

You want to make a list of words to listen for and we can have those trigger the audio override?

I have put a suggested list for several internationally popular Chinese shows on your desk. Hopefully you can find it!

谢谢你. You have made many fans of popular shows like *Get The Throne* happy to know they are not in danger of spoilers as they walk into the office in the morning. Certainly my wife Xiaomei and I are very much looking forward to last night’s episode knowing that we will be genuinely shocked by the events to come…
